competition between car manufacturers to see who can produce the fastest vehicle. \n\n00:00:10\nThis is a constant battle and changes fairly often. \n\n00:00:13\nSo today, I've decided to put together the top 10 fastest cars in the world. \n\nEffects\n00:00:18\n[MUSIC] \n\nGranty\n00:00:19\nNumber 10, with a top speed of 253 miles per hour, the Bugatti Veyron was once the fastest car in the world, back when it was originally released in 2005. \n\n00:00:30\nSince then, there has been multiple different editions and versions of the car. \n\n00:00:34\nSome with just cosmetic changes and some with enhanced performance, which you will see later on in the video. \n\n00:00:41\nNumber 9, based loosely on the Porsche 911, and tuned by the German company 9FF, the GT9-R has a top speed of 257 miles per hour. \n\n00:00:53\nA power output of 1,120 horsepower, and a naught to 60 time of only 2.9 seconds. \n\n00:01:00\n9FF also repositioned to the engine to the middle of the car instead of the classic Porsche rear engine for better weight distribution. \n\n00:01:09\nNumber 8, successor to the Koenigsegg CCX and CCXR, the Agera R has a top speed of 260 miles an hour and a naught to 60 time of 2.8 seconds. \n\n00:01:21\nThe car was originally released back in 2011 by the Swedish company and features a mid-engine five liter twin-turbocharged V8. \n\n00:01:29\nIt is also in my opinion one of the sexiest cars ever made and I wish I had the millions of dollars it costs to buy one. \n\n00:01:37\nNumber 7, the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport is a faster, more powerful version of the original Bugatti Veyron. \n\n00:01:44\nIt has a crazy top speed of 267.7 miles an hour, although it's electronically limited to 258 miles an hour to protect the tires from disintegrating. \n\n00:01:55\nProduction was limited to just 30 units, and each of those units cost a hefty 1.2 million pounds. \n\n00:02:02\nNumber 6, with a top speed of 270.4 miles an hour, the Hennessey Venom GT is one of the fastest cars in the world. \n\n00:02:11\nIt set this record back in February 2014 at the three-mile long Kennedy Space Center shuttle landing strip in Florida. \n\n00:02:18\nHowever to qualify for the world record, Hennessey have to have built and sold over 30 cars. \n\n00:02:24\nCurrently, they're only on 16. \n\n00:02:26\nNumber 5, so I doubt many of you will have heard of the XT version of the SSC Ultimate Aero, but this special edition released back in 2013 has a mind-boggling top speed of over 273 miles per hour. \n\n00:02:42\nOnly five of these machines were ever built and the other stats are pretty crazy too. \n\n00:02:46\nIt has a 1,300 horsepower, 6.9 liter twin turbo V8 engine and a seven speed paddle-shifted shifted gear box. \n\n00:02:55\nNumber 4, next, we have the very rare, very expensive, and very fast Koenigsegg One:1. \n\n00:03:02\nOnly seven of these vehicles were built, and have already been sold this year. \n\n00:03:07\nThe name One:1 comes from the power 1,361 PS to weight 1,361 kilograms ratio, giving the car 1 PS per 1 kilogram of weight. \n\n00:03:18\nThis beast of a machine can reach naught 60 in 2.8 seconds, and tops out at a ridiculous 273.4 miles an hour. \n\n00:03:28\nNumber 3, next up at the number 3 spot is the upcoming Bugatti Chiron, which will have an insane top speed of around 286 miles an hour. \n\n00:03:39\nThis will be coupled with a 1,500 horsepower 8 liter W16 quad turbo engine. \n\n00:03:44\nIt will also be able to go to naught 60 in under 2.2 seconds. \n\n00:03:49\nIt has been confirmed that only 500 of the Chirons will be produced and they will cost in excess of 1.8 million pounds. \n\n00:03:57\nNumber 2, so this machine is one of the craziest things I've ever seen. \n\n00:04:03\nBuilt by Dubai-based company Devel, the Sixteen hosts a mid-mounted V16 engine that produces over 5,000 horsepower, yes 5,000, which will catapult it from naught to 60 miles an hour in just 1.8 seconds. \n\n00:04:20\nOh, and it also has a top speed of 348 miles an hour. \n\n00:04:25\nNo, I did not say that wrong. \n\n00:04:27\nIt actually goes 348 miles an hour. \n\n00:04:30\nHere's a short clip so you can quickly take a listen. \n\n00:04:33\n[SOUND] Number 1, coming in at number one is the fastest car ever produced. \n\n00:04:54\nThe Thrust Supersonic car or Thrust SSC is a British jet-propelled car developed in the 1990s. \n\n00:05:01\nIt set the world land speed record on the 15th of October, 1997 when it achieved a speed of 763 miles per hour and became the first car to officially break the sound barrier. \n\n00:05:13\nSince then, nothing has even come close to beating the Thrust SSC and it still remains the fastest car in the world going into 2016. \n\n00:05:22\nAnd those guys were the top 10 fastest cars in the world. \n\n00:05:26\nIf you enjoyed the video, leave a like down below. \n\n00:05:28\nLet's aim for 303 likes, that would be awesome. \n\n00:05:31\nAlso don't forget to click that
