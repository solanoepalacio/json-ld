<p class="transcript">What's up, everyone.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:00:03</div>
<p class="transcript">So there is a lot of competition between car manufacturers to see who can produce the fastest vehicle.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:00:10</div>
<p class="transcript">This is a constant battle and changes fairly often.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:00:13</div>
<p class="transcript">So today, I've decided to put together the top 10 fastest cars in the world.</p>

<div class="fx">Granty</div>

<p class="transcript">Number 10, with a top speed of 253 miles per hour, the Bugatti Veyron was once the fastest car in the world, back when it was originally released in 2005.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:00:30</div>
<p class="transcript">Since then, there has been multiple different editions and versions of the car.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:00:34</div>
<p class="transcript">Some with just cosmetic changes and some with enhanced performance, which you will see later on in the video.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:00:41</div>
<p class="transcript">Number 9, based loosely on the Porsche 911, and tuned by the German company 9FF, the GT9-R has a top speed of 257 miles per hour.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:00:53</div>
<p class="transcript">A power output of 1,120 horsepower, and a naught to 60 time of only 2.9 seconds.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:01:00</div>
<p class="transcript">9FF also repositioned to the engine to the middle of the car instead of the classic Porsche rear engine for better weight distribution.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:01:09</div>
<p class="transcript">Number 8, successor to the Koenigsegg CCX and CCXR, the Agera R has a top speed of 260 miles an hour and a naught to 60 time of 2.8 seconds.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:01:21</div>
<p class="transcript">The car was originally released back in 2011 by the Swedish company and features a mid-engine five liter twin-turbocharged V8.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:01:29</div>
<p class="transcript">It is also in my opinion one of the sexiest cars ever made and I wish I had the millions of dollars it costs to buy one.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:01:37</div>
<p class="transcript">Number 7, the Bugatti Veyron 16.4 Super Sport is a faster, more powerful version of the original Bugatti Veyron.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:01:44</div>
<p class="transcript">It has a crazy top speed of 267.7 miles an hour, although it's electronically limited to 258 miles an hour to protect the tires from disintegrating.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:01:55</div>
<p class="transcript">Production was limited to just 30 units, and each of those units cost a hefty 1.2 million pounds.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:02:02</div>
<p class="transcript">Number 6, with a top speed of 270.4 miles an hour, the Hennessey Venom GT is one of the fastest cars in the world.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:02:11</div>
<p class="transcript">It set this record back in February 2014 at the three-mile long Kennedy Space Center shuttle landing strip in Florida.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:02:18</div>
<p class="transcript">However to qualify for the world record, Hennessey have to have built and sold over 30 cars.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:02:24</div>
<p class="transcript">Currently, they're only on 16.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:02:26</div>
<p class="transcript">Number 5, so I doubt many of you will have heard of the XT version of the SSC Ultimate Aero, but this special edition released back in 2013 has a mind-boggling top speed of over 273 miles per hour.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:02:42</div>
<p class="transcript">Only five of these machines were ever built and the other stats are pretty crazy too.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:02:46</div>
<p class="transcript">It has a 1,300 horsepower, 6.9 liter twin turbo V8 engine and a seven speed paddle-shifted shifted gear box.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:02:55</div>
<p class="transcript">Number 4, next, we have the very rare, very expensive, and very fast Koenigsegg One:1.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:03:02</div>
<p class="transcript">Only seven of these vehicles were built, and have already been sold this year.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:03:07</div>
<p class="transcript">The name One:1 comes from the power 1,361 PS to weight 1,361 kilograms ratio, giving the car 1 PS per 1 kilogram of weight.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:03:18</div>
<p class="transcript">This beast of a machine can reach naught 60 in 2.8 seconds, and tops out at a ridiculous 273.4 miles an hour.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:03:28</div>
<p class="transcript">Number 3, next up at the number 3 spot is the upcoming Bugatti Chiron, which will have an insane top speed of around 286 miles an hour.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:03:39</div>
<p class="transcript">This will be coupled with a 1,500 horsepower 8 liter W16 quad turbo engine.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:03:44</div>
<p class="transcript">It will also be able to go to naught 60 in under 2.2 seconds.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:03:49</div>
<p class="transcript">It has been confirmed that only 500 of the Chirons will be produced and they will cost in excess of 1.8 million pounds.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:03:57</div>
<p class="transcript">Number 2, so this machine is one of the craziest things I've ever seen.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:04:03</div>
<p class="transcript">Built by Dubai-based company Devel, the Sixteen hosts a mid-mounted V16 engine that produces over 5,000 horsepower, yes 5,000, which will catapult it from naught to 60 miles an hour in just 1.8 seconds.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:04:20</div>
<p class="transcript">Oh, and it also has a top speed of 348 miles an hour.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:04:25</div>
<p class="transcript">No, I did not say that wrong.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:04:27</div>
<p class="transcript">It actually goes 348 miles an hour.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:04:30</div>
<p class="transcript">Here's a short clip so you can quickly take a listen.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:04:33</div>
<p class="transcript">[SOUND] Number 1, coming in at number one is the fastest car ever produced.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:04:54</div>
<p class="transcript">The Thrust Supersonic car or Thrust SSC is a British jet-propelled car developed in the 1990s.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:05:01</div>
<p class="transcript">It set the world land speed record on the 15th of October, 1997 when it achieved a speed of 763 miles per hour and became the first car to officially break the sound barrier.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:05:13</div>
<p class="transcript">Since then, nothing has even come close to beating the Thrust SSC and it still remains the fastest car in the world going into 2016.</p>

<div class="time-location">00:05:22</div>
<p class="transcript">And those guys were the top 10 fastest cars in the world.</p>
